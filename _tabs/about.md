# My Cybersecurity Portfolio

### About Me
I'm a passionate and driven cybersecurity enthusiast specializing in web application penetration testing with a strong foundation in offensive security principles. I am well-versed in identifying and exploiting OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, including XSS, SQLi, SSRF, IDOR, and RCE, and have a strong grasp of payload crafting and bypass strategies. I also regularly analyze public bug bounty reports to deepen my understanding of real-world attack scenarios and advanced exploitation techniques.

I'm actively involved in Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions and structured vulnerability research through platforms like PortSwigger Web Security Academy. I continuously evolve my skills through self-driven research, red team simulations, and staying up-to-date with emerging threats, CVEs, and zero-day exploits.
